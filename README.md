## Installation via CocoaPods
The recommended way to integrate Kamcord is CocoaPods. This makes the
process pretty easy, and enables automatic updating as well.

 * Add `pod 'Kamcord'` to your `Podfile`
 * Execute `pod install` to download the framework and integrate it with
   your project.
 * Ensure you have added the <a href="https://github.com/kamcord/kamcord-ios-sdk/wiki/Getting-Started#framework-dependencies">framework dependencies</a> as well.

## Details
